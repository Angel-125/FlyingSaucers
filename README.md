Kerbal Flying Saucers: Build Flying Saucers in KSP!

Have you ever wanted to pretend that your kerbals found a crashed flying saucer and then reverse-engineered it? With Kerbal Flying Saucers (KFS), now you can! KFS is a mod that lets you research and build your own custom flying saucers that work within established gameplay mechanics while providing an exotic twist. It’s as easy as mixing and matching components to create a vehicle suited to your needs. And with its custom tech tree branch you can simulate your reverse-engineering efforts via the stock science system.
Kerbal Flying Saucers supports Pathfinder, MOLE, DeepFreeze, OSE Workshop, KIS/KAS, CTT, Snacks, TAC-LS, and more.
