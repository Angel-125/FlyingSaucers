{
	name = wbiS4GraviticEngineCore
	description = Gravitic generators produce static charge as a byproduct. If a vessel accumulates too much static charge, then generators will shut down as a safety measure to prevent explosions.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiS4Cockpit
	description = In flight, as with all crewed saucer parts, you can change seats through the part action window. Just right-click the part and press the Change Seats button.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiS4GraviticEngine
	description = The most effective use of Crazy Mode is to activate Hover mode first, then lift off, and stay in Hover mode while using Crazy Mode. Speed is controlled by throttle, direction is controlled by translation keys, and duration is limited by your supply of gravity waves.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiS4HalfOuterStorageSection
	description = Although the crashed UFO's hull appears seamless, it is actually comprised of dozens of programmable nanometal panels. Our reverse-engineered panels have some impurities in them which result in variations in their appearance.

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiAVR0Coanda
	description = Unlike other jet engines, the Coanda can be used with the VTOL Manager for precision VTOL flight. Its sophisticated flight control computer varies the exhaust so that its center of thrust is always at the craft's center of mass.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiHoverjet
	description = Unlike other jet engines, the Nexus can be used with the VTOL Manager for precision VTOL flight. Be sure to place the engine so that one or more Nexus engines produce thrust along the craft's center of mass.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiA51GravimetricGenerator
	title = Graviolium Sources
	description = The Gravimetric Generator runs on Graviolium, a rare resource that produces gravity waves when charged with electricity. You cannot launch a vessel with Graviolium; you must find it after launch. You can produce Graviolium in the Refinery but it's a slow and expensive process. You can also mine asteroids for Graviolium, and collect small amounts of it in the exopshere of some worlds with the Stardust collector. Finally, with Pathfinder installed, you can prospect for small deposits of Graviolium.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiA51GraviticEngine
	title = Crazy Mode
	description = Once you've upgraded the Gravitic Engine, you get Crazy Mode. By consuming large amounts of gravity waves, your craft can rapidly move around without experiencing high g-forces. Be sure to use the VTOL Manager to activate Crazy Mode. The Gravitic Engine always places its center of acceleration (center of thrust in a traditional engine) at the center of mass. The same goes for its gravitic RCS thrusters.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiSmallFusionReactor
	title = Finding Propellium
	description = The Gravitic Fusion Reactor requires both GravityWaves and Propellium. You can produce Propellium using the Hydroscoop and simply land a craft in an ocean or other body of liquid. Fortunately the Hydroscoop is small, light, and easily carried by flying saucers. You can also produce Propellium from Ore via the ISRU parts. The fusion reactor also produces wbiElectroPlasma, which is perfect for Plasma RCS thrusters.

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiK2Supercomputer
	title = Reverse-engineering Flying Saucers
	description = The Kray Kray and the Saucer Reverse-Engineering experiment both have a small chance to unlock saucer technologies before unlocking the required tech nodes.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiStardust
	title = Collecting Graviolium
	description = Don't want to produce Graviolium in the Refinery? Don't want to mine asteroids? Then the Stardust is for you! Just place the part in a planet's exosphere and let it slowly collect dust-form Graviolium over time. Not all worlds have Graviolium dust in their exosphere though, but the Stardust will tell you what it finds.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiPlasmaContactor
	title = Getting Rid of StaticCharge
	description = Generating Gravity Waves from Graviolium produces Static Charge that is stored in capacitors. Once those capacitors are full, the generators can no longer produce Gravity Waves. To get rid of Static Charge, you need a Plasma Contactor. Its effectiveness varies with environment; landed/splashed gives the best discharge rate, atmospheres are a bit worse, and vacuum conditions have the lowest discharge rate. To discharge in a vacuum, you also need a supply of XenonGas.

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiPlasmaContactorModule
	title = Getting Rid of StaticCharge
	description = Generating GravityWaves from Graviolium produces StaticCharge that is stored in capacitors. Once those capacitors are full, the generators can no longer produce GravityWaves. The Plasma Contactor Module is specially designed for space station. Vessels dock to the station, and the module drains the ship of its StaticCharge and discharges it based on the environment. A station that is landed or splashed gives the best discharge rate, atmospheres are a bit worse, and vacuum conditions have the lowest discharge rate. To discharge in a vacuum, you also need a supply of XenonGas.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiTailFin
	title = Flying Saucers: Tail Fins
	description = When flown like a normal aircraft, flying saucers need flight control surfaces. The Tail Fin is one such control surface. Stick this on the back of the saucer to keep it pointed correctly.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiBodyFlap
	title = Flying Saucers: Body Flaps
	description = When places along the aft rim of a flying saucer, the body flap helps the craft stay pointed in the right direction. You can switch between two styles of body flap.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiArcWing
	title = A Specialized Wing
	description = The Arc Wing is especially designed to work in combination of the A-51 Engine Mount and aft-mounted A-51 Cargo Bay parts. It keeps the wing from clipping into the cargo bay.
}

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiA51Cockpit
	title = Balancing CoM & CoL
	description = To help balance the saucer's Center of Mass and keep it ahead of its Center of Lift, all saucer sections have space for lead ballast.

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiS4InnerStorageSection
	title = Attaching Outer Sections
	description = You can setup the part's attahment nodes to attach either two standard outer sections or one standard outer section and two half-sized outer sections. You can tell what configuration you're in by the hatches.
