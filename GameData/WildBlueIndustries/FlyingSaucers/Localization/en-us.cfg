		// size1GraviticEngine
		#LOC_KFS_size1GraviticEngineTitle = GND-00 "Baryon" Gravitic Engine
		#LOC_KFS_size1GraviticEngineDesc = Like the prior generation of gravitic engines, the GND-00 "Baryon" focuses gravity waves into an artificial singularity that enables a vessel to "fall" in the desired direction of travel. But unlike the previous generation, the GND-00 is an advanced, compact design that contains a fusion reactor and a gravimetric displacement generator in addition to the singularity projector. The end result is a self-contained system that allows vessels to fly via gravity.

		#LOC_KFS_size2GraviticEngineDesc = Like the prior generation of gravitic engines, the GND-01 "Quantum" focuses gravity waves into an artificial singularity that enables a vessel to "fall" in the desired direction of travel. But unlike the previous generation, the GND-01 is an advanced, compact design that contains a fusion reactor and a gravimetric displacement generator in addition to the singularity projector. The end result is a self-contained system that allows vessels to fly via gravity.

		// Gravitic Fusion Reactor
		#LOC_KFS_BlueshiftDesc = This fusion reactor uses gravitic displacement fields (a.k.a. Gravity Waves) to crush Fusion Pellets until they fuse. The resulting Electro Plasma is then tapped to produce Electric Charge. The plasma has other uses such as supplying propellant for electro-plasma RCS thrusters.
		#LOC_KFS_FFTDesc = This fusion reactor uses gravitic displacement fields (a.k.a. Gravity Waves) to crush Liquid Deuterium until it fuses. The resulting Electro Plasma is then tapped to produce Electric Charge. The plasma has other uses such as supplying propellant for electro-plasma RCS thrusters.
