		#LOC_KFS_size1GraviticEngineDesc = Like the prior generation of gravitic engines, the GND-00 "Beta" focuses gravity waves into an artificial singularity that enables a vessel to "fall" in the desired direction of travel. But unlike the previous generation, the GND-00 is an advanced, compact design that contains a fusion reactor and a gravimetric displacement generator in addition to the singularity projector. The end result is a self-contained system that allows vessels to fly via gravity.
