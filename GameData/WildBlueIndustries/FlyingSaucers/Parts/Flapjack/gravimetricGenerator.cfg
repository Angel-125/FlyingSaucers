	manufacturer = <CLASSIFIED>
	description = The Gravimetric Displacement Generator is designed to zap Graviolium with ElectricCharge to produce GravityWaves which can then be used for various purposes. The process also produces StaticCharge which must be discharged from the vessel. If the craft accumulates too much StaticCharge, then the generator shuts down. The generator also has a backup RTG to serve as an auxilary power source.
