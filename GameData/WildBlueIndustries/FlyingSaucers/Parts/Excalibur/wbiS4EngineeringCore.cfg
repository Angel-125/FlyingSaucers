	description = More than just a simple structure for attaching saucer sections, the Engineering Core has a powerful gravimetric displacement generator that produces gravity waves by zapping graviolium with electric charge. Static charge is also generated; if the vessel accumulates too much, the generator will shut down. Additionally, the Engineering Core has a gravitic fusion reactor, an emergency atomic battery, and powerful gyro rings.
