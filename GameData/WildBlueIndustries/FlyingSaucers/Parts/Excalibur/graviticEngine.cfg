	description = Using revolutionary technologies reverse-engineered from crashed flying saucers, the Gravitic Engine creates localized distortions in space-time thousands of times per second. The artificial singularity is then projected so that the vessel "falls" in the desired direction of travel. Its maximum acceleration is affected by the mass of the vessel; the higher the mass, the more GravityWaves required to propel the ship.
