	basicInfo = Crazy Mode enabled. Velocity: 10km/sec. Runs until stopped or the supply of gravity waves runs out.
	manufacturer = <CLASSIFIED>
	description = Charging graviolium with positive current generates gravity waves that enable craft to "fall" in the desired direction of travel. Recent experiments charged graviolium with negative currents to produce inverted gravity waves, causing an expansion in space-time that pushes craft away from the singularity. By combining the two, space itself can be moved without changing the vessel's velocity. In theory this will allow for faster than light travel, but for now, this crazy mode of travel enables saucers to move just a few kilometers at a time.

	description = Modifications to the singularity/inverted singularity generators, combined with better timing control software, has improved the maximum velocity possible for moving space-time itself. It's only a matter of time before we can achieve faster than light travel.
