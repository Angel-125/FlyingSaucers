	description = Gravimetric displacement generators produce StaticCharge when generating GravityWaves. If the vessel accumulates too much StaticCharge, then the generators will shut down. A plasma contactor eliminates the charge by venting ionized xenon gas in vacuum conditions, but if the craft is landed, splashed, or flying in an atmosphere then it can eliminate StaticCharge as well.
